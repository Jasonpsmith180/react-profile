# React-Profile

## Description
As a developer your portfolio is very important. It can show potential employers what you are capable of and my portfolio was in need of an update. So I remade my portfolio in React since I had just started to learn it.
All of the pages conditionally render with a gallery of my projects with links to the github repos as well as the deployed applications. I have a contact section as well as a resume section that employers can take a look at or contact me if they want.  

The app is published at [React Profile](https://jasonpsmith180.github.io/react-profile/).

## Installation
